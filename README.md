# Flight-Computer
A simple rocket flight computer to track the flight states and and perform accordingly i.e. fire pyro charges or use the buzzer. Uses ESP8266, BMP180 barometer, and MPU6050 6-axis accelerometer soldered onto a protoboard to be as accesible as possible. The computer utilizes sensor fusion for state changes. The wiring diagram is pictured below:
